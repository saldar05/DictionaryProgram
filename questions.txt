0. pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis is a disease of the lungs  generated by silica dust.
1. Reports Kernel usage that are reported only once application looses context.
2.  Because copies of the struct, if passed by value, can be placed on the stack.
3.  2
4.  Essentially, that for loop is looking at each character from the a word within the text file.Once it has read in all the characters, 
    it resets itself to read in a new word. Once all the characters have been concatenated, it calls load to compare that word to one
    that is in the dictionary of words.If it returns true, misspellings are incremented.

5.  fgetc will read in a character at a time. While fscanf will read in a string or more. Plus, if each word is stored on its on row, followed
    by a newline, then fgetc is built in to read in that sort of input.
6.  Because no changes to the character  const was needed. Once read in, the word just needed to be compared to a word in the dictionary. Also,
7.  I, with the help of sparknotes(I cited them in my code), implemented a hash table with pointers pointing to the words.A hasvalue was created
    and based on that hashvalue, a word was created at that specific point in memory.Essentially, a hashtable was created, along with a linked list
    to allow pointers to point to the words in memory.
8.  A little slow for sure.
9.  I  found my bottlenecks by(mainly in the load function), and made the process easier by removing code that was a bit redundant.
10. No.
